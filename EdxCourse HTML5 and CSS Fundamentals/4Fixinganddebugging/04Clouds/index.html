        <p>Among the many types of clouds are:</p>

        <ol>
            <li id="cumulus">Cumulus clouds: <img alt="Cumulus Clouds" src="http://www.weather.gov/images/jetstream/clouds/cu.jpg"></li>
            <li id="cirrus">Cirrus clouds: <img alt="Cirrus clouds" src="http://www.weather.gov/images/jetstream/clouds/ci.jpg"></li>
            <li id="stratus">Stratus clouds: <img alt="Stratus clouds" src="http://www.weather.gov/images/jetstream/clouds/st.jpg"></li>
        </ol>
        <p>
           Any style setting for the img width will take precedence over the attribute setting (width="500"), so our img settings intended for the other images will change that one too

          When working with relative measures (.5em) styles panel doesn't tell us a lot about the actually font-size in absolute terms; we can use the "Computed" tab. The "Computed" tab contains the values of all the CSS properties that apply to the current element.  There are a lot of them, and they're listed in alphabetical order. 
        </p>
        <img src="images/P22.png" />
        <p>
          This tells us that the font-size on the innermost list item is only 3px.  No wonder it's unreadable! 
          When we click on the triangle we can expand the details on font-size, which makes a little more clear what's going on.  We see that the font-size on the body is 24px, but there are several repetitions of the li .5em.
        </p>
        <img src="images/P39.png" />   
        <p>
          If we look at the next outer list item, we see that the font-size is 6px, and the one outside of that is 12px.  This doubling makes it clear what's happening.  Each nested <li> element has a font-size 1/2 the size of its parent, because the em unit is relative measurement, depending on the current font-size.

          Now that we know what's happening, we can fix it in a few different ways.  We could use an absolute unit like px or pt, but a better solution would be rem.  This would make the size relative to the html font-size (the default font-size for the page), not to it's surroundings.

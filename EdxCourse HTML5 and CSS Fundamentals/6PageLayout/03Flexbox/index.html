    <h2>Sizing and Dimension. Default behavior</h2>
    <p>
      The default sizing behavior depends upon the display property for an element.  
    </p>
    <h3>Inline</h3>
    <p>Inline elements take the size of their content plus any padding. Additionally, inline elements ignore any explicit sizing properties (width, height, etc.) unless they are also position:absolute or position:fixed.  This leads to a lot of confusion when newbies are working with inline elements. If you have an inline element whose size you want to indicate explicitly, you should probably change it to inline-block.</p>
    <h3>inline-block</h3>
    <p>Inline-block elements also take the size of their content, plus padding. However, they respect any explicit sizing properties.  This is handy.</p>
    <h3>block</h3>
    <p>By default when no sizing properties are used, block level elements take the width of their parent and the height of their content. Block level elements respect any explicit sizing properties.</p>
    <h3>images - aspect ratio preserving</h3>
    <p>Images have an interesting behavior in that if only one dimension is set, the other is automatically calculated so that the original aspect ratio of the image is preserved.  This is true for both decorative CSS images and img tags.</p>

    <p>Look again at the descriptions for inline-block and block level elements above, you will notice that inline-block elements are sized (height and width) to their content.  And block level elements take the width of their parent and the height of their content. So these elements are fundamentally variably sized, and this variability is one of the most powerful and useful aspects of these elements. The <em>min-width</em> and <em>min-height</em> properties allow us to set a minimum boundary for that variability, but otherwise the variable sizing of the element is unimpeded. So if we have min-width:300px; that means the element will be 300 pixels or possibly wider.</p>
    <p>Unless you have good cause, try to avoid using explicit dimension properties like width and height.  If you must control the dimensions, consider using the min- or max- variants. </p>

    <h2>OverFlow, overflow-x and overflow-y properties</h2>
    <p>
      With common text, overflowing normally only occurs in the vertical direction. overflow-x and overflow-y properties specify whether to clip content or to add scrollbars when an element's content is too big to fit in a specified area. 
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>auto Typically, if a scroll bar is needed, it is shown, but if it is not needed, no scroll bar is shown</li>
      <li>scroll  The overflow is clipped, but a scroll-bar is always added to see the rest of the content</li>
      <li>Visible The overflow is not clipped. It renders outside the element's box. This is default</li>      
      <li>hidden The overflow is clipped, and the rest of the content will be invisible</li>
      <li></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      If we say that some block level element is supposed to have a height and width of 100 pixels, does that include the border or the padding? The default behavior of the browser is that the sizing properties govern the size of the content area and any padding or borders are "extra".  But, if this is not the desired behavior, you can change it. <br>

      We can change the default using the box-sizing properties that determines how the sizing properties are applied.
      <ul>
        <li>content-box (default) the height or width properties affect the content box of the element and any padding or border is "additional".  </li>
        <li>border-box he sizing properties are used to set the "whole" size of the element, and the content size is likely to be less</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>How is important?</h2>
    If you are manipulating items with JavaScript, then it may be important. If you are using any of the "older" methods for CSS layout (like floats, tables, etc.), then managing the box model is of paramount importance
    if you are using the flexbox layout (which we begin in the next section), then the box-model is not that important. The rule of thumb is that the more you are directly managing the size of items, the more likely you will need to change the box-sizing property to be border-box.

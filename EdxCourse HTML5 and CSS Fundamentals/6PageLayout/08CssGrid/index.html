      Flexbox and Grid are not competing layout techniques. Grid arranges in two dimensions, while Flexbox lays out in one. There is synergy when using the two together.<br>
      CSS Grid is a CSS module that defines a two-dimensional grid-based layout system, optimized for user interface design. In the grid layout model, the children of an element (the ‘grid container’) can be positioned into arbitrary slots in a predefined flexible or fixed-size layout grid. <br>
      The idea behind the Grid module is that you split the box that makes up an element into many individual ‘slots’, arranged in a matrix, and separated from each other by (invisible) horizontal and vertical lines. You do that with a property called 'grid', which contains the desired number of rows and columns and/or their sizes. Each child element goes into a slot, so that they end up aligned as in a table. But you have full control over which slot they go into, you can change their order, they can span more than one row or column, and you can leave some slots empty.

      Because they can refer to a previously defined grid of horizontal and vertical lines, the properties from the CSS Grid module provide more control over the alignment of elements than most other properties in CSS, such as the table-related properties or the 'float' and 'clear' properties, while also allowing elements to be displayed out of order. As such they are especially appreciated for (Web) applications with user interfaces that are made with HTML and CSS.

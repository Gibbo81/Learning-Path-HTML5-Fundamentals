    <div>
       So far our grid items have each been contained within a single grid cell, but we can achieve more useful layouts by breaking beyond those boundaries
    </div>
    <section class="grid-1 gridgeneric">
      <div class="item-1">1</div>
      <div class="item-2">2</div>
      <div class="item-3">3</div>
      <div class="item-4">4</div>
      <div class="item-5">5</div>
      <div class="item-6">6</div>
      <div class="item-7">7</div>
      <div class="item-8">8</div>
      <div class="item-9">9</div>
    </section>
    <div>
      The unchanged  items fill the available space automatically. This highlights perfectly how a grid layout doesn’t have to reflect the source order of the elements.
    </div>
    <div>
      Grid Template Areas allow us to name areas on the grid. With those areas named, we can reference them (instead of line numbers) to position our items
    </div>
    <section class="grid-2 gridgeneric">
      <div class="item-A">A</div>
      <div class="item-B">B</div>
      <div class="item-C gridgeneric">
          <div class="item-C1">C1</div>
          <div class="item-C2">C2</div>
          <div class="item-C3">C3</div>
      </div>
      <div class="item-D">D</div>
    </section>
    <div>
      A given web page will contain all kinds of nested components, so let’s see how that works with Grid. <br>
      When we declare a grid container display: grid; only its direct descendants become grid items. Content we add to those child elements will be completely unaffected by Grid unless we specifically say otherwise.
      <br>So, to recap:
      <ol>
        <li>grid-column offers us a shorthand way of defining where an item starts and ends.</li>
        <li>We can also use the span keyword to make our rules more flexible</li>
        <li>grid-template-areas give us the power to name our grid areas.</li>
        <li>We can also nest grids by declaring grid items as display: grid; and following the same process.</li>
      </ol>
    </div>

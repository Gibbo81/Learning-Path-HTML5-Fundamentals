    <div>
      We can control when these grids come into effect using media queries, meaning we can completely redefine our layout at different viewport widths.
      We can change the grid disposition if the moniter is shorter than 500px
    </div>
    <section class="grid-2 gridgeneric">
      <div class="item-A">A</div>
      <div class="item-B">B</div>
      <div class="item-C gridgeneric">
          <div class="item-C1">C1</div>
          <div class="item-C2">C2</div>
          <div class="item-C3">C3</div>
      </div>
      <div class="item-D">D</div>

     Our approach up until now has been to dictate how many tracks there are and watch the items fit accordingly <br>
     With the auto-fill keyword we can dictate how wide our tracks are and let Grid figure out how many will fit in the available space.<br>
     We use grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, 9em); which says “make the columns 9em wide each, and fit as many as you can into the grid container <br>
     If we use minmax(9em, 1fr) for columns width Grid would place as many 9em tracks as possible, but then expand them to a maximum of 1fr until the container is filled <br>
     grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(9em, 1fr));
    </div>
    <section class="grid-1">
      <div class="item-1">1</div>
      <div class="item-2">2</div>
      <div class="item-3">3</div>
      <div class="item-4">4</div>
      <div class="item-5">5</div>
      <div class="item-6">6</div>
      <div class="item-7">7</div>
      <div class="item-8">8</div>
      <div class="item-9">9</div>
    </section>

      <li>Media queries can help us completely rearrange Grid layouts by redefining grid-template-areas (and other things) for different scenarios.</li>
      <li>The auto-fill keyword is useful for filling up grid containers.</li>
      <li>The minmax() function complements auto-fill nicely, making sure containers are properly filled, but doesn’t give us “responsiveness” in the true sense of the word.</li>

    <div>
      It’s quite possible to use CSS positioning on grid items <br>
      You’ll notice, if you resize the window, that the grid item continues to behave (resize) exactly as it was before we repositioned it, and it’s still, selfishly, reserving its place in the grid in case it feels like coming back. <br>
      So what happens when we absolutely position that item? it will position itself against its closest ancestor which has a declared position value. If you don’t set position: relative; (for example) on the grid container, the grid item will fly out of the grid’s boundaries in search of something else to hold onto, such as the html element. <br>
      It has effectively been removed from the document flow, as is normal with absolutely positioned elements. Its slot in the grid has been filled by the other items <br>
      You’ll also see that it no longer has the dimensions it was using when it was part of the grid. It has shrunk to the size of its contents. The grid doesn’t influence the sizing of the element, and the element doesn’t influence the sizing of the grid in any way
    </div>

    <section class="grid-1">
      <div class="item-1">1</div>
      <div class="item-2">2</div>
      <div class="item-3">3</div>
      <div class="item-4">4</div>
      <div class="item-5">5</div>
      <div class="item-6">6</div>
      <div class="item-7">7</div>
      <div class="item-8">8</div>
      <div class="item-9">9</div>
    </section>
    <div>
      Why would you need positioning with Grid? Initially it might seem like overkill. But when you consider broken grid layouts and moving beyond the straightforward “across and down” web pages we’ve become used to, I think you’ll find positioning quite useful.

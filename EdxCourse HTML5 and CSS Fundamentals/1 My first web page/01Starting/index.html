Less than    '<' USE: &lt;       
Greater than '>' USE: &gt;
Ampersand    '&' USE: &amp;
Quotes       '"' USE: &quot;

Tag names are "case insensitive"
Attributes are case sensitive
as in js double and single quotes are almost interchangeable, but they have to match

<!--
We have been emphasizing the general rule that HTML is for the logical structure of your content, not what it looks like.  Well, nothing is perfect, including this goal. There are some HTML elements that are primarily used to satisfy certain formatting requirements. 
- <hr> horizontal line
- <br> or <br/> break line
- <pre> PRE stands for "PREformatted text", meaning "text is good, don't mess with it." 
-->
  <hr>
  <pre>
  Text in a pre element
  is displayed in a fixed-width
  font, and it preserves
  both      spaces and
  line breaks

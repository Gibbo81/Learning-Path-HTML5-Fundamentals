      Tables are used to arrange data in tabular format - rows and columns of cells. You can put a variety of data like text, images, forms, links and even other tables in your table.
      In earlier days, when layout options were limited, many developers resorted to tables as a means of layout.  There's really no need to do that anymore, there are plenty of layout capabilities in CSS3.  Tables were not intended as a layout tool, but there absolutely nothing wrong with using them for their intended purpose - making tables.
      <ul>
        <li>They are semantically incorrect for layout because they represent presentation and not content.</li>
        <li>It puts presentation data in your content making your HTML larger. The user must download this unnecessary presentation data for every page they visit.</li>
        <li>tables are not very screen reader friendly. Using tables for layout will clutter your HTML making it harder for assistive technology to parse your Web page.</li>
        <li>Redesigns are harder when your HTML is cluttered with presentational code that should go into CSS. To change the layout of the page, you shouldn't be editing your content. Instead, you should just have to make CSS related changes</li>
        <li>Using CSS (one or two external stylesheets for your whole Web site) is easier to maintain consistency among pages</li>
      </ul>

    <table border=1>
      <caption><p>pippo</p></caption>
      <tr>
        <th colspan="2" scope="col">Name</th>
        <th>Age</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>MR.</td> 
        <td>Alexa</td>
        <td>23</td>
      </tr> 
      <tr>
        <td>Ms.</td> 
        <td>Nicole</td>
        <td>45</td>
      </tr> 
    </table>

    <p>There are two types of cells in a table: header and standard. 'th' creates table header cells. The content of table header cells is bold and centered by default. 'td' creates standard cells</p>
    <p>scope attribute (th) Specifies if a header cell is the header for a row, column, rowgroup or colgroup Possible values: row, col, rowgroup, colgroup, auto</p>

    <table border=1>
      <colgroup>
        <col span="2" style="background-color:green">
        <col span="1" id="col2" >
      </colgroup>
      <tr>
        <th colspan="2" scope="col">Name</th>
        <th>Age</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>MR.</td> 
        <td>Alexa</td>
        <td>23</td>
      </tr> 
      <tr>
        <td>Ms.</td> 
        <td>Nicole</td>
        <td>45</td>
      </tr> 
    </table>

      colgroup tag allows you to group columns in a table. Grouping columns is useful if you want to specify properties for a group of columns like applying styles to the whole column instead of repeating it for each cell.
      col tag specifies the column property for each column within a colgroup. The only element a colgroup can contain is col. Attribute span takes a positive integer value. It specifies the number of columns you want the col element to span (cover).

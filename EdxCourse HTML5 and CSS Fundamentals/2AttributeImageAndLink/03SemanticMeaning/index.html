      Semantic HTML is HTML that concentrates on the meaning of information in Web pages instead of its presentation or look.
      Semantic tags, like p, suggest the purpose of the content within the tags
      From a semantic HTML perspective, using the right tags is important. You should use blockquote to wrap a quote and
      not use a paragraph tag and then style it to look like a quote.
      For presentation purposes, you can achieve the same using CSS, but how something looks has very little to do with what
      it means. This is why in HTML, we separate content and style.

      Tags such as article, section, header, nav and footer were specifically introduced in HTML5 to define the Web page
      structure. These new semantic elements give meaning to different parts of a webpage

    header is simply an area to add any introductory content about your page. It can contains headings, paragraphs, tables, images, logos and even navigation

      <h1>HTML 5.2</h1>
      <h2>W3C Recommendation, 14 December 2017</h2>
    </header>
    header can and frequently does contain headings h1 to h6
    Header and footer elements are for the parent element (section, article, division or body) that they are used in.
    If you have multiple sections or articles, then you can have one header and footer for each.
    Header and footer elements can also be used site-wide at the top and bottom of the body of the Web page.
    This type of header will typically contain logos, main heading, a search area and site-wide navigation and the footer
    will typically include authoring information, references and other links, copyright information etc.

    <h2>nav</h2>
    The nav element represents a section of a page that links to other pages or to parts within the page: a section with
    navigation links.

      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.w3.org/2009/cheatsheet/">w3</a></li>

      Attributes are used in tags to further define the tag:
      Attributes are a name-value pair used inside a tag and should be added after a space from the tag name: <ol start="5">. The start attribute is used inside the <ol> tag. 
      The only exception to the name-value pair is if the attribute is a 'boolean attribute'. These attributes have only two types of values - true or false. But instead of writing "true" or "false" for its value, you add the attribute name to indicate true and omit it to indicate false
    -->
    <ol start="7" id="cinema" class="attribute-list">
      <li>Light</li>
      <li>Camera</li>
      <li>Action</li>
    </ol>

    <!--
    id attribute is really useful to identify a single element it's very similar to your school or corporate ID that is unique to you. No one else in your company will have the same ID as you because we know that two people having the same ID will just cause a lot of confusion.
    Class is similar to id but is not unique in a page. it should be used for all the settings that are common to different elements
    -->
    <p id="para1" class="poetry">I am paragraph 1 and I want to be in red</p>
    <p id="para2" class="poetry">I am paragraph 2 and I want to be in blue</p>

    <!--
    There are two kind of attributes: Global and Non-global.
    Global attributes can be applied to all tags. Examples of global attributes are id and class.
    Non-global attributes are attributes applied to a specific instance of a tag. Start is an attribute for the <ol> tag and it cannot be applied on the <p> or <h1> tags.

      Attributes are used in tags to further define the tag:
      Attributes are a name-value pair used inside a tag and should be added after a space from the tag name: <ol start="5">. The start attribute is used inside the <ol> tag.
      The only exception to the name-value pair is if the attribute is a 'boolean attribute'. These attributes have only two types of values - true or false. But instead of writing "true" or "false" for its value, you add the attribute name to indicate true and omit it to indicate false

      Characters earn XP for every encounter they overcome.
      The XP reward for completing an encounter is
      the sum of the XP values for each monster, NPC, trap,
      or hazard that makes up the encounter. You noted or
      assigned this number when you built the encounter,
      to judge its difficulty against your players. (Published
      adventures note the XP value of each encounter they
      contain.) Divide the XP total for the encounter by the
      number of players present to help overcome it, and
      that’s how many XP each character gets.
      Overcoming an Encounter: What counts as overcoming
      an encounter? Killing, routing, or capturing
      the opponents in a combat encounter certainly counts.
      Meeting the success conditions of a skill challenge is
      overcoming it. Remember that an encounter, by definition,
      has a risk of failure. If that risk isn’t present, it’s
      not an encounter, and the characters don’t earn XP. If
      the characters accidentally trigger a trap as they make
      their way down a hallway, they don’t get XP because it
      wasn’t an encounter. If the trap constitutes an encounter
      or is part of an encounter, though, they do earn XP
      if they manage to disarm or destroy it.
      Say the characters avoid a hydra to get into the treasure
      vault it guards. Do they get XP for overcoming
      the challenge of the hydra? No. If the treasure was the
      object of a quest, they get the reward for completing
      the quest (see Quest Rewards on page 122), which
      should include XP as well as treasure. But because
      they didn’t have an encounter with the hydra, they
      didn’t overcome the challenge. (If they sneak past,
      trick, or defeat the hydra in an encounter, they do
      earn XP.)
      XP for Combat Encounters: The Monster Manual
      indicates the XP reward each monster is worth. That
      number comes from the Experience Rewards table
      on this page, and it depends on the monster’s level. A
      minion is worth one-quarter of the XP of a standard
      monster of its level. An elite monster is worth twice
      as much XP, and a solo monster is worth five times as
      much XP.
      If you apply a template to a monster (see page 175),
      you turn it into an elite or solo monster (see “Creating
      New Solos,” page 185) and therefore adjust its XP
      value. Likewise, if you alter a monster’s level, its XP
      value changes.
      A nonplayer character counts as a monster of his
      or her level for calculating XP. Traps and hazards that
      serve as combat complications also have levels. If the
      characters overcome a combat encounter where a trap
      or hazard presented a threat during the encounter,
      give them XP for the trap or hazard even if they didn’t
      disable or neutralize it. They overcame the challenge it

      Near future campaigns are usually set on Earth, before interstellar travel is
      developed. The classic near-future setting has a brilliant scientist or evil organization (or
      both) who develop mecha or robots, and then try to take over the world. The future may
      be "today with flying cars," or it may be a grimmer "cyberpunk" future with cyborgs and
      genetic engineering running rampant. Alien invasions are also popular, since a near-future
      setting gives the humans an excuse to develop a few super-mecha of their own to defend
      Earth. However, a "war in our solar system" in which Earth, the moon and rival space
      colonies are the battleground can provide a more visceral struggle than one between
      distant empires. The campaign may also be set on a post-apocalyptic Earth, after the
      war's desolation: the Wild West with dirt bikes, souped up cars, cyborgs and mutants.
      Player character bounty hunters with their bazooka and trusty hoverbikes may set out to
      stop the human scum and their transforming mecha bikes.
      Anime/Manga Examples — Bubblegum Crisis, Dominion Tank Police, Genesis
      Survivor Gaiarth, Ghost in the Shell, Mobile Suit Gundam, Neon Genesis Evangelion.

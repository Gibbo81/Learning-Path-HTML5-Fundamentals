    <p id="par_1">Earlier we saw that the b and strong tags would make text bold-faced. However, semantically speaking, that is a mere side-effect of the tag. Any tag can make the text bolder (or less bold) via the font-weight CSS property.  While common values are normal and bold, text can also be made bolder (or less bold) than its parent with the values bolder and lighter. Lastly, the font-weight can be set explicitly as a numeric value. The choices are: 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800 and 900.    normal maps to 400 and bold to 700. However, the different numeric choices will only work for fonts that support a full range of font-weights. Many times the numeric weights will simply be mapped back to bold or normal.</p>
